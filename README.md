# Welcome ðŸ‘‹
I am a student of computer science at the Goldsmiths, University of London. I am interested in a variety of subfields namely, artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks, natural language processing, quantum computing, and operating system development, amongst others. Although I major in computer science, my interests also extend to other fields such as physics, mathematics, psychology, sociology, and economics.
